According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekyia), “in ancient Greek cult-practice and literature, a **nekyia (ἡ νέκυια)** is a ‘rite by which ghosts were called up and questioned about the future.'” Forensics is finding the remnants of a past, listening to the whispers, and linking them into a conversation. It is from this conversation that conclusions, theories, and actions stem. Ultimately, in the legal realm, this process directs the fate of others.

Erik Musick currently performs incident response in the retail industry. He has practiced Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) in government and financial sectors. For a full resume, please visit [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emusick).
