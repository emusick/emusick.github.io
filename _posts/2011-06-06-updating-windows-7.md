For those running Windows 7 and breezing through the update screens, you may be missing some important updates. Namely, anything that isn&#8217;t an operating system update. The unintuitive, easy to miss option &#8220;Get updates for other Microsoft products&#8221; &#8220;find out more&#8221; link is located in the middle of the Update pane under the update history statistics. Once enabled (a small download that probably toggles a registry &#8212; haven&#8217;t investigated), other product updates, such as Office, will begin showing as possible updates.

**TL;DR**

Enable &#8220;Get updates for other Microsoft products&#8221; if you want Office updates.
