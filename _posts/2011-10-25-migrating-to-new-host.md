I began creating content on SquareSpace, but over time a few issues arose; namely, the ability to nicely format and present code examples. In attempting to remedy this I have moved to WordPress hosted with Host Gator. As soon as I decide the best way to migrate old posts over, I will begin adding new content beginning with some shared Evernote entries.
