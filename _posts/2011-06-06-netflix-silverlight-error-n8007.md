If you are receiving a Silverlight Application Storage Error with code N8007 using Mozilla Firefox, you might check [TomTaylormsft&#8217;s post on Silverlight.net](http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/t/179653.aspx#526378 "Troubleshooting tips for Silverlight") for troubleshooting information. If the three listed links all work it may be as &#8220;simple&#8221; as disabling Private Browsing mode. To accomplish this, head to Options -> Privacy and &#8220;Use custom settings for History&#8221;. Obviously not ideal, but a simple toggle to enable watching Netflix. If you really do not wish to modify this setting, you may consider running a separate browser (such as Chrome) specifically for Netflix.

**TL;DR**

Private browsing kills Netflix.
