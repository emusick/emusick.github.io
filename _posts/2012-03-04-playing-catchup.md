It has been a while since I&#8217;ve posted. There have been a number of articles that I&#8217;ve wanted to publish, but each has had an issue. I&#8217;ll address two for now.

The Forensic Intelligence script, as I originally conceived it, has been abandoned. The script was a wrapper for Nirsoft tools. As I was writing the script, everything appeared to be checking out in that I was getting results. Unfortunately, those results were of my own machine and not of the mounted image file. A few of the tools do not support the command line and even more are inconsistent in their implementation meaning the reports wouldn&#8217;t be as polished as I had hoped. Combining these two issues, I&#8217;ve stopped work on this project.

The Evernote post and forensic note sharing is another story. For a long time, I struggled with how to present my notes to the community. [David Gold](https://plus.google.com/u/0/100600034652261299279/posts "David Gold's Google Plus account") reached out after I mentioned his [book](http://www.degconsulting.net/evernote.html "Gold's Evernote ebook") on G+ and I ran across this after some of his linked articles: &#8220;It’s your system, and no one else will be using it. It only needs to make sense to you.&#8221; In this whole process, I forgot that first and foremost these are my notes that I&#8217;ve accumulated or written over time. I&#8217;m only sharing that and with it my organization (madness). Without further adieu &#8230;

Update 2016-04-12: All Evernote shares have been removed.

I have not included a few notes since they include personal information or sensitive materials (LES/FOUO). I do have a Legal notebook that I&#8217;d like to share in the near future, but I have to clean up the content quite a bit. The above notebooks will be heavily changed with topics broken out more, but I really wanted to get this out there. I&#8217;m not expecting much feedback or use out of it, but I think it&#8217;s a shame how little our community shares. Hopefully this will help break some of that resistance at a bare minimum.

Any suggestions and feedback would be greatly welcomed. There is a ton of content and resources out there. It is impossible to find and archive it all, but I&#8217;ve found that some stuff is just hard to find if you don&#8217;t save it. That is my goal and I do hope you find a use for it.
