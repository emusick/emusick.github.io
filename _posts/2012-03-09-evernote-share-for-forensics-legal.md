2016-04-12 Update: This article is outdated and the share has been removed.

I was able to get most of my legal notes organized. Every case law mentioned should have a corresponding link to an archived copy; available within the Evernote share. Some archived links required uploading a PDF. Hopefully it all came together in a useful way.

While the web links are OK, if you have the [Evernote client](http://www.evernote.com/evernote/ "Evernote client information page") installed, you can link these to your account by clicking the &#8220;Link to my Account&#8221; button in the top right. It makes reading and navigating much more enjoyable.

The previous article had an error in the Forensic &#8211; Windows link and has been fixed.
