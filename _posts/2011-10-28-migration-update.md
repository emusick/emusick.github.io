2016-04-11 Update: Removed broken Forensic Artifacts link

All of the posts have been copied over. I noticed that many of the posts had numerous typos in them. These, hopefully, have been addressed and will occur in fewer amounts due to the clearer edit pane used by WordPress. We shall see.

I expedited the migration a bit since Jimmy Weg graciously linked my Forensic Artifacts page yesterday. That page was quite ugly, so I have moved the domain for those who are slow to read mailing lists; this should be much easier to read.

Any linked files will point to the old site (hopefully) and they will be migrated this weekend. The RSS feed is not redirected as I had hoped. There are some other minor kinks to work out, but hopefully this is a better format.

Questions and comments are always welcome. If something looks wrong, please feel free to holler.
