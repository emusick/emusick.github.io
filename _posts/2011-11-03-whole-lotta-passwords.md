It seems that every time the topic of password cracking comes up, there is a question that quickly follows: &#8220;do you have a dictionary?&#8221; There are a number of websites that maintain lists of default passwords for equipment. Two that seem to receive a bit of attention are [SearchLores](http://www.searchlores.org/defpasslist1.htm "SearchLores default password list") and [Liquid Matrix](http://www.liquidmatrix.org/blog/default-passwords/ "Liquid Marix password list"). However, [Skull Security](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords "Skull Security's leaked password lists") took things a bit further and have provided links to various leaked databases that have appeared in the last year. These are real passwords used at live sites.

I decided to take all three and combine them into a single master list. I have also included the leaked account names from the recent [#OpDarknet](http://pastebin.com/u/opdarknet "Pastebin releases for #OpDarknet"). While not passwords, these account names are descriptive for a particular niche lending to the possibility that they may also be passwords. Either way, they are included. If someone believes there is a better way to distribute this, please comment. The original files are separated, but were consolidated for this post.

The file [WholeLottaPasswords.7z](/content/dl/WholeLottaPasswords.7z "Compressed archive of passwords") weighs in at 36.6 MB compressed and 150 MB uncompressed. It contains 14,504,798 unique lines. Enjoy.

As a counter-point to this article, if you find yourself using the same password at multiple sites, weak passwords, or you find your password in this list &#8230; you may want to read [Password Management](http://erikmusick.com/password-management.html "Password Management").
