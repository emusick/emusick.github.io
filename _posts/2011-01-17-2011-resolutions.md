I never have been big on &#8220;resolutions&#8221; as they sounded too fixed and give the impression of change. However, lately, I have been interested in tracking what I do and working on goals. So, here they are&#8230;the 10 things I hope to see this year:

  1. Play more chess
  2. Start and release a coding project (ie. inventory or report tracker)
  3. Pick up martial arts again and tone up
  4. Attend SANS and a Magpul training class
  5. Increase my daily vocabulary
  6. Begin studying German again
  7. Pick up ham radio again
  8. Travel overseas (ie. Germany or Japan)
  9. Take up photography
 10. Continue this blog and develop better online writing skills
