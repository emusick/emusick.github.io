Erik Musick's personal blog. This is the migrated home of my Host Gator site. I have been casually looking for an alternative to get away from Wordpress. When I read [Joanna Rutkowska's](https://github.com/rootkovska/rootkovska.github.io) post on her migration, I liked what I read. When I saw her site, I liked what I saw. To that end, I began my own migration with the help of Joanna's work and [Jonathan McGlone's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) post about leveraging GitHub's Jekyll support without installing Jekyll. This is the result.
